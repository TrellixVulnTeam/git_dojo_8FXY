from django.db import models

# Create your models here.

# remember to always:
# python manage.py makemigrations
# python manage.py migrate
# when making any changes in model.py! Think of it as saving.

# Start up Django shell to enable CRUD commands:
# python manage.py shell
# from app_name.models import class1, class2, etc...
